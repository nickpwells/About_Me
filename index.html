  <h1 class="intro-header">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="intro-body">I'm 23 years old, recently graduated from Purdue University with a degree in Construction Engineering and Management with a minor in Economies.  I work as a project engineer for a construction management company located in Dallas, TX.  I like my job because I get to work closely with a skilled team of engineers and work towards turning designs into multi-million dollar structures.</p>
  <p class="intro-body">After reading many blog posts, listening to a number of podcasts, and perusing a variety of articles, I concluded that programming is an extremely valuable and resourceful skill to learn.  My goal is to possess the skills to allow me to build fun and creative projects.</p>
  <p class="intro-body">I'm pumped to be able to work closely with a mentor at Thinkful as well as have access to a strong, diverse community of fellow students and teachers.</p>

  <h1 class="hometown-header">Where I'm From</h1>
  <p class="hometown-body">I was born and raised in Indianapolis.  I called Indy home until I was 22 years old, upon which I moved to Dallas for work.</p>
  <P class="hometown-body">What I love most about Indy are the sports and the people.  I grew up with a great group of friends, all of whom are doing awesome things in a wide variety of fields.  The same group of friends and I got to watch our hometown team win a Super Bowl as well, which is a rare opportunity for most.</p>
